Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns for best starting points to hit final goal.

Kickstarter campaigns which are successful demonstrate a few key components. First, the timing. Successful Kickstarters began in mid to late spring, primarily those in May had the most success. While the goal amount of successful campaigns ranged from $1000 - $6000, further analysis revealed the average successful compaign reached a pledge amount of around $1000 with the top amound being around $1500.
